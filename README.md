# COVID-19-prediction-with-different-models
In this course project, I use different models to predict COVID-19 data, including deep learning model like LSTM, and traditional Epidemic models like logistic model, SEIR model.

Country_data.csv includes Chinese COVID data at the beginning of COVID-19. us_virus includes the confirmed-cases data of the United States from the beginning of COVID to July in 2021. 

Particularly, the LSTM prediction use the historical American COVID data for training and validation and the last twenty days for prediction.
